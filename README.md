### üíº **Work Experience**

#### **Business Aanalyst Intern | Sigma Calibration Labs (February 2023 - August 2023)**
‚óè Enhanced Inventory Management: Developed analytical models using Python and SQL that improved the accuracy of inventory forecasts by 20%. This initiative directly contributed to a reduction in stock shortages by 18%, ensuring optimal inventory levels and minimizing operational disruptions.

‚óè Designed interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI connected to AWS Redshift for real-time performance monitoring: Developed interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI linked directly to AWS Redshift, which displayed key operational metrics for real-time tracking of calibration processes. Incorporated machine learning forecasts into the dashboards, enabling predictive insights that allowed management to address potential delays proactively. This approach led to a 14% reduction in decision-making time, enhancing data accessibility and enabling timely responses to operational needs.

‚óè Cost Reduction Initiatives: Led a data-driven analysis project that scrutinized procurement and logistics operations. By identifying inefficiencies and negotiating better terms with suppliers, achieved a 12% reduction in overall supply chain costs. This involved detailed cost-benefit analysis and collaboration with finance and procurement departments to align strategies with business goals.

‚óè Operational Efficiency and Supplier Collaboration: Partnered with the operations team to implement a new strategic framework that increased the on-time delivery rate from suppliers to 98%. This was achieved by enhancing supplier performance tracking and establishing more rigorous criteria for supplier selection based on data-driven insights.

‚óè Data Visualization and Reporting: Spearheaded the creation of dynamic dashboards and comprehensive reports using Power BI, which tracked key performance indicators (KPIs) and operational metrics. These tools provided executives and team members with real-time insights into supply chain operations, facilitating quicker decision-making and fostering a culture of transparency and accountability.

‚óè Cross-functional Team Collaboration: Actively collaborated with IT and marketing teams to integrate analytics into broader business operations, resulting in more cohesive strategies that leveraged data across departments. This cross-pollination of ideas and data helped streamline operations and enhanced overall business intelligence capabilities.

### üèÜ **Featured Projects**

#### Stock Probability Model for Inventory Optimization
- Integrated safety stock levels and demand variability into the model. This strategy was tailored for items with high demand variability, which significantly reduced the risk of stockouts by 30% during peak demand periods.
- The model achieved a 91% accuracy rate in predicting stockout risks for high-demand products. It was instrumental in reducing stockout incidents by 40%, leading to an estimated annual savings of $200,000 in lost sales and increased customer satisfaction.

#### Supplier Performmance Analysis
- Crafted a comprehensive supplier evaluation model in Excel, using weighted scoring criteria for delivery timeliness, cost effectiveness, and quality performance. This model improved the selection process by quantifying supplier performance, resulting in a 15% overall increase in supply chain reliability.
- Engineered an interactive Power BI dashboard to effectively visualize supplier rankings, trends, and key performance indicators. The dashboard facilitated enhanced decision-making, leading to a 20% improvement in procurement efficiency by highlighting performance bottlenecks and enabling quick corrective actions.
- Applied advanced operational management principles, including supplier scorecards and Pareto analysis, to refine procurement strategies. This approach not only streamlined supplier evaluations but also boosted supply chain efficiency by 25%, minimizing lead times and reducing costs associated with underperforming suppliers.

#### Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Social Media Using LLMs
- Achieved 92% accuracy in emotion detection by combining **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with computer vision algorithms across 10k social media posts.

#### [Detection of Dyslexia Based on Eye Movements](https://github.com/parthgawande/Detection-of-Dyslexia-based-on-eye-movements)
- Led a project using machine learning to analyze over 47 eye movement patterns, achieving 91% accuracy in dyslexia detection.
